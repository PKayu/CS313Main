                My name is Dan Worwood and am a current student at BYU-Idaho Online.
                I live in Houston, Texas with my wife and two daughters and work as
                as Software developer at a local software company. In my free time I
                play guitar, wrestle my girls, and tinker on my raspberry pi.

                While I currently live in Houston, Texas, my true roots are in Southern
                Utah. Above is an image my father drew for me to remind me of home. While
                I enjoy the lush green of Houston, I often miss the reds and oranges of the
                rocks that are found in Southern Utah.
